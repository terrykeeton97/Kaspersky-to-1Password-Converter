## ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. Open the solution file (.sln).
2. Build the project in Realese (x86) or Release (x64).

## ðŸ§ª Usage

1. **Place the file in a simple directory root (E.g: C:\)**
2. **Open CMD and navigate to the directory where the `kcsv.exe` file is located: `cd path\to\directory`**
3. **Place your Kaspersky Password Manager exported .txt file in the same location as the executable**
4. **In CMD, type the following command, replacing `YOURFILENAME.txt` with the name of your exported .txt file: `kcsv.exe YOURFILENAME.txt output.csv`**
5. **Hit Enter, and it will generate the `output.csv` file in the same directory as the executable.**

For example, if your file is named `passwords.txt`, the command would be: `kcsv.exe passwords.txt output.csv`
