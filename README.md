## ðŸ§ª Usage

1. **Place the file in a simple directory root (E.g: C:\)**
2. **Open CMD and navigate to the directory where the `kcsv.exe` file is located: cd path\to\directory**
3. **Place your Kaspersky Password Manager exported .txt file in the same location as the executable**
4. **In CMD, type the following command, replacing `YOURFILENAME.txt` with the name of your exported .txt file: kcsv.exe YOURFILENAME.txt output.csv**
5. **Hit Enter, and it will generate the `output.csv` file in the same directory as the executable.**

For example, if your file is named `passwords.txt`, the command would be: kcsv.exe passwords.txt output.csv
